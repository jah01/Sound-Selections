    title: "Prom Night",
    artist: "Chance the Rapper",
    album: "10 Day",
    label: "N/A",
    release: DateTime(2012, 4, 3),
    description: "Chance the Rapper's first tape, 10 Day, includes a light tune about a night he admits he never experienced. Sampling Brenda Russell's So Good, So Right (1979), Chance raps about graduation, growing up, and of course, prom night. At the end of the song, he pulls the rug from under your feet, and the beautiful methaphores of royalty and the Grammys disappear as he explains he missed prom, and adds that he would do it again if given the chance. This is one of my favorite Chance songs not only because the melody favors Russell's piano over the all-too-common bass in raps, but also because of the unique echo-y lines that give the first verse some energy to set the stage for a memorable song.",

    label: "RCA Records",
    release: DateTime(2014, 2, 18),
    description: "Originally released as Jack Antonoff's debut single and later incorporated into his debut studio album, I Wanna Get Better is an incredible collaboration of a pounding, cathartic melody with a heavy message of growing up and dealing with the struggles of life (and death). Still one of the most popular songs in Bleacher's impressive repertoire, IWGB blends emotional vocals, powerful piano, and a meaningful story that sets the stage for Antonoff's later music. If you need one of those car songs or if you like to belt out lyrics, this one's sure to go above and beyond your expectations.",

    release: DateTime(2017, 6, 28),
    description: "LANY's first album, by the same name, includes Super Far, a snapping, clapping, and shouting song about breaking up. LANY goes through the emotions of someone who is super far from home (hence the name) as they try to figure out why they are still in a relationship with someone who doesn't care and \"doesn't even try.\" This catchy tune is my favorite from the album, but be sure to check out Thick and Thin by LANY and Mean It by Lauv, the latter LANY is featured in.",
