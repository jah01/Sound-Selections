    description: "Chance the Rapper's first tape, 10 Day, includes a light tune about a night he admits he never experienced. Sampling Brenda Russell's So Good, So Right (1979), Chance raps about graduation, growing up, and of course, prom night. At the end of the song, he pulls the rug from under your feet, and the beautiful metaphors of royalty and the Grammys disappear as he explains he missed prom, and adds that he would do it again if given the chance. This is one of my favorite Chance songs not only because the melody favors Russell's piano over the all-too-common bass in raps, but also because of the unique echo-y lines that give the first verse some energy to set the stage for a memorable song.",

Still one of the most popular songs in Bleacher's impressive repertoire, IWGB blends emotional vocals, powerful piano, and a meaningful story that sets the stage for Antonoff's later music.

LANY goes through the emotions of someone who is super far from home (hence the name) as they try to figure out why they are still in a relationship with someone who doesn't care and \"doesn't even try.\" This catchy tune is my favorite from the album, but be sure to check out Thick and Thin by LANY and Mean It by Lauv, the latter LANY is featured in.",

The title is pretty self-explanatory, but the song dives deep into the feeling of no longer having a person in your life.
