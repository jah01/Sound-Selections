# Sound Selections

An app for discovering my recent music finds in a visually aesthetic UI.

This app is very loosely based on the general UI of [abuanwar072's "Movie-Info---Flutter-UI](https://github.com/abuanwar072/Movie-Info---Flutter-UI).

Note: App contains images that are copyrighted. Absolutely no copyright infringement is intended. No part of the final product (the app) is for commercial purposes; I do not intend to make any money off of this creation. All album images are of fair use because they accompany the commentary of the review. All images of people who worked on the song are of fair use as well, because it can be argued that the nature of the work (in this case, the image of the person or groups of people) helps the user identify who assisted with the help of each song. Additionally, the images of people are not an important part of the work and only take up a small amount of space in each window that includes a song; they are not at the center of what the app is to be used for, which is reviews of songs. To sum it all up in the relation to copyright, this app is not for a profit and educational, and any unintended copyright infringement on my part shall and will be fixed by me as long as this project is a public repository on Github.
